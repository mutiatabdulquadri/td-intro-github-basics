introduction to git and github
Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
Version control also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code.
the process of committing a project to github repository includes initializing git with "git init", then we add files with "git add",we commit the files to remote repository by entering "git commit" and the we push to the remote repository with "git push".git status can also be used to check if everything is working fine
